# 🌈 RGB Components Detector

This project presents the design and implementation of an **RGB components detector**, developed as part of the *Optoelectronics 2* course at Wrocław University of Science and Technology.

The device measures the **RGB color components** of the environment and displays the results on a 2x16 LCD screen and the Arduino serial monitor. It is powered by a 9V battery and uses a TCS3200 color sensor and an RGB LED.

This project was developed by a team:

- Radosław Mierzwa  
- Pavlo Kostushevych  
- Mateusz Gwioździk
